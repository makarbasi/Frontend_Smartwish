# Marketplace Migration to Tremendous API

## Overview

The marketplace has been completely replaced with a new implementation based on the Tremendous API for real gift card generation. This replaces the previous mock marketplace with actual gift card functionality.

## Changes Made

### Files Replaced
- `src/app/marketplace/page.tsx` - Complete new marketplace UI matching the tremendous-demo design
- `src/app/api/marketplace/route.ts` - Updated to proxy to Tremendous API
- `src/app/api/tremendous/products/route.ts` - New API route for fetching Tremendous products
- `src/app/api/tremendous/generate-gift-card/route.ts` - New API route for generating gift cards

### Files Removed
- `src/app/marketplace/[slug]/page.tsx` - No longer needed with the new implementation

### Configuration Updated
- `env.example` - Added `TREMENDOUS_API_KEY` configuration

## Setup Instructions

1. **Get a Tremendous API Key**
   - Sign up at https://tremendous.com/
   - Navigate to API settings in your dashboard
   - Copy your API key (use test environment for development)

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Copy the environment template
   cp env.example .env.local
   
   # Edit .env.local and add your Tremendous API key
   TREMENDOUS_API_KEY=your_tremendous_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd smartwish-frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Features

### New Marketplace Features
- Real gift card products from Tremendous API
- Live gift card generation with redeemable links
- **QR code generation and display**: When a gift card is purchased, a QR code is prominently displayed instead of just a link
- QR code download functionality for easy sharing
- Voice search functionality
- Category filtering (Gift Cards, Charity, Prepaid Cards)
- Responsive design matching the tremendous-demo

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/tremendous/products` - Fetches available gift card products
- `POST /api/tremendous/generate-gift-card` - Generates a redeemable gift card link
- `GET /api/marketplace` - Backward compatibility proxy to Tremendous API

## Technical Details

### Product Structure
```typescript
type Product = {
  id: string
  name: string
  category: string
  image?: string
  minAmount: number
  maxAmount: number
  availableAmounts: number[]
}
```

### Gift Card Generation Response
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  redemptionLink: string,
  orderId: string,
  amount: number,
  productName: string
}
```

## Migration Notes

- The old marketplace data structure is maintained for backward compatibility
- All existing marketplace routes continue to work but now use Tremendous data
- The UI has been completely redesigned to match the tremendous-demo style
- Voice search and QR code generation are new features added with this migration

## Testing

1. Navigate to `/marketplace`
2. Search for gift cards using the search bar or voice input
3. Click on a gift card to open the generation modal
4. Enter an amount within the allowed range
5. Generate a gift card link
6. Test the redeemable link (opens Tremendous redemption page)

## Security Notes

- The Tremendous API key is server-side only and never exposed to the client
- All gift card generation happens through secure API routes
- Links are generated with Tremendous's secure redemption system
